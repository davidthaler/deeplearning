## Deep Learning
This repo holds my work on deep learning, using keras and tensorflow.

Most of the projects come from three main sources:

* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/)
* [keras](https://keras.io/)
* The codelab at [Martin Gorner's github](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial).

I highly recommend the codelab, and also the [slides](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/)
from Martin's talk.
